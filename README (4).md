## WHAT IS RESOLUTION 
Image resolution describes the image’s level of detail – higher resolution means more image detail. In digital imaging, the resolution is often measured as a pixel count. A pixel (short for picture element) is a single point or a tiny square in a graphic image stored in an ordered rectangular grid.
## HIGH RESOLUTION
Image resolution is typically described in PPI, which refers to how many pixels are displayed per inch of an image. Higher resolutions mean that there more pixels per inch (PPI), resulting in more pixel information and creating a high-quality, crisp image.
## LOW RESOLUTION
"Low resolution" is a relative term. Compared to a high-resolution image, low-resolution images have fewer pixels, higher compression, or both. They sacrifice quality of the image for a smaller file size. Low-resolution rasterized images, such as photographs, may appear blurry or indistinct.
